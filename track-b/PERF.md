# Track B: performance log

Every step from the reference to your final version, each with the live-board run ID that measured it. Judges check that the run IDs exist and that each change moved the way you say it did.

| Step | Change | Run ID | T (s) | M (MB) | Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | The reference, unchanged | | 56.35 | 2200 | 0 |
| 1 | Rust v1: queries read first; one parallel pass keeps postings for query terms only and checks phrase windows at each phrase's trigger term | run-af10ba01e8f3 | 0.711 | 180.0 | 53.6 |
| 2 | Term keys read with one masked 32-byte load; tokens found 64 bytes at a time from AVX2 masks | run-03e880c5be0a | 0.5555 | 182.1 | 55.5 |
| 3 | Costly BOOL queries evaluated on per-chunk bitsets and id lists, the rest checked per document; one 16-byte prefetched probe per token; first matches grouped per thread | run-0ba4a60c4e07 | 0.4085 | 82.7 | 60.9 |
| 4 | Queries parsed on every thread into flat arrays; the plan's per-term lists built with one counting sort | | | | |

A second run of the step 1 code, run-85b6361ddf94, measured 0.703 s and 181.1 MB.

Local numbers below come from 12 threads on the P-cores (CPUs 0-11, turbo off), full seed 1,
`perf stat -r 5`, with the variants interleaved over three rounds.

## Step 2: term lookup and tokenizer

- **Lookup:** term keys sit densely by id, and a token's key is one 32-byte load from the mapped
  file, masked to the token's length and lowercased with a shift, instead of a `memcpy` into a
  zeroed buffer that the next load then stalled on.
- **Tokenizer:** two AVX2 compares turn 64 bytes into a token-byte mask and an LF mask. Token
  starts and ends are `token & !prev` and `!token & prev`, walked with `trailing_zeros`, so no
  loop looks at single bytes. Locally: 0.632 → 0.579 s, cycles 14.60 → 13.27 G.

## Step 3: costly BOOL queries on sets, the rest per document

Seed 1 has 36.3 million tokens, and 79% of them are one of the 75,747 distinct query terms.
Step 2 appended every hit to a posting list (about 640,000 `Vec`s across the threads) and then
merged lists per query. The profile split evenly between the term lookup, the appends, and the
merges, and the lists set the 174 MB peak.

- **3a, two evaluation paths.** Each BOOL query gets a cover: terms such that every matching
  document holds one of them. If the cover holds a common term (one in at least 1 in 32 sampled
  documents), the pass records the query's terms as sets instead: a bit per document for common
  terms, an id list for rare ones. Those 1,772 queries are evaluated after the pass with
  word-wide AND, OR and AND-NOT, 64 documents per operation. The count is a popcount, and the id
  sum comes from six masked popcounts per word. The other 29,000 queries are checked at the end
  of each document that holds a cover term (17.4 million checks). Each check is a flat,
  self-contained program run against a per-document term bitset that fits in L1.
- **3a, one probe per token.** Each slot of the term table (16 bytes) holds a term's first 8 key
  bytes, its id, and flags saying what the pass does with it. A token thus costs one load, and
  only the rare term longer than 8 bytes reads the rest of its key. Each document's probes are
  prefetched as it is tokenized and resolved at its LF, so the loads overlap instead of
  stalling one by one.
- **3b, first matches.** Each thread groups its chunk's first ten matches per query with a
  counting sort over the match counts it already keeps. This replaced one serial sort of 1.25
  million (query, doc) pairs between the pass and the output.

Locally, step 2 → 3a → 3b: elapsed 0.584–0.592 → 0.469–0.534 → 0.427–0.429 s; cycles 13.28–13.56 →
9.97–10.08 → 10.04–10.09 G; memory.peak 173.3 → 82.1 → 79.7 MB. S went from 484 to 745.

## Step 4: the serial start

Before the pass, one thread parsed the queries and built the plan while the other eleven
waited: 56–59 ms of a 0.43 s run.

- **Parse, 32 → 15 ms.** Every thread parses a share of the query lines into flat arrays. One
  thread then gives each distinct term its id, in file order, so the ids do not depend on the
  thread count. It loads the table slot of the term 16 ahead while it interns one, so the
  cache misses overlap, and when the table doubles it is rebuilt from the keys in id order.
- **Plan, 25 → 15 ms.** A query's terms and operators sit in flat arrays instead of two `Vec`s
  per query. The phrases and checks each term triggers are collected as pairs and grouped by
  one counting sort, instead of a `Vec` per term.

Locally, step 3 → 4: elapsed 0.4335–0.4380 → 0.3905–0.3929 s; cycles 9.97–10.05 → 9.84–9.87 G;
memory.peak 79.2 → 69.2 MB. S went from 745 to 803.

## Experiments that did not stay

- **Every BOOL query checked per document, with no sets at all** (step 3 without the sets):
  1.29 s, 29.0 G cycles, 53.3 MB, against 0.63 s and 14.6 G for step 2. That meant about 100
  million evaluations, each chasing a query's heap-allocated terms and operators.
- **Step 3a's two paths with per-term arrays instead of table slots:** 15.1 G cycles, 0.64 s,
  76 MB, against 13.2 G and 0.58 s for step 2. With 75,747 terms, every hit touched about six
  random cache lines: the 1 MB slot array, 2.4 MB of keys, the last-seen array, the store array,
  and two 1.8 MB arrays of `Vec` headers. Moving the flags into the slots fixed that.
- **Term table grown at 3/4 load instead of 1/2** (2 MB of slots instead of 4): cycles 11.07 →
  11.53 G, elapsed 0.535 → 0.55 s, memory 81 → 77.7 MB. The longer probe runs cost more than the
  smaller table saved.
- **One per-document loop shared by the sample and the pass**, taking closures: fewer code
  lines, but cycles 10.0 → 10.6 G and instructions 12.25 → 13.60 G. A shared probe function
  that returned the slot cost 4% more cycles on its own. The pass keeps its loop inline.
- **A term table sized for every term occurrence up front** instead of doubling: parse
  13.8–14.7 → 10.7–11.0 ms, but 8 MB of slots instead of 4, as the queries hold 152,904 term
  occurrences and only 75,747 distinct terms.
